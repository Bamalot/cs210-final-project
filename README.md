# cs210-final-project
This is the final project for my CS210 computer science course

This project was simulating an item-tracking program for a grocery store. The program loads data from a file and allows the user to search for how often an item appears in that file. The user can also request the frequencies of all items, or even have them graphed in a histogram.

I enjoyed working on this project and I thought that the padding of the console output turned out nice.

I could work on the efficiency of the code because it uses a rather simple method of associating the item names with their frequencies.

The most challenging part of this project was deciding what class I wanted to build because I was required to use at least one class in the program. I opted for creating a "Database" class that represented the data loaded from the data file.

Of course, working with C++ to load files, output user-requested data, and store it in a back up file in an object-oriented manner could be applied to other more advanced projects.

I did my best to make the program understandable, both with comments and the naming convention of the class and its methods. I also left room to expand the program by using a simple and logical structure.
